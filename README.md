# MVP

This is a full-stack application that allows the user to input max numbers of certain lifts and then compare the new numbers to previous numbers to see exactly how much progress has been made in any given workout cycle.
Ideally, this would be used in conjunction with workout programs to determine whether adjustments need to made in the program for the following cycle to continue/improve progress in any given lift.
